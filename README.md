# The Color Mixer

The color mixer accesses data that is placed into a txt file. The data should be two colors, sent as seperate strings to a txt file. The color mixer will then access the colors from the txr file and determine a mix of these colors and return the RGB and HEX version of the new color. Once a mix has been established, the new color mix's RGB and HEX will be sent back one at a time to the txt files so that they can be retreived for use.

Communication with mixer.py is done only through the python files <--> txt file.

To add more colors to choose from, you can add in the color string and the RGB notation of it to the if, then sections of mixer.py
